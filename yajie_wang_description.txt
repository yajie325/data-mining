Method Description：
I mainly use the ensemble learning method, based on the user-based CF， item-based CF, lsh+ item-based CF and machine learning. In the homework, I found that the accuracy of CF is not good. So I add a way that use the machine learning method to extract feature values from other JSON files. After testing a variety of machine learning methods, I found that linear regression can get the highest accuracy, and finally combine all way to train the model, I use linear regression to train the model to get better accuracy.
